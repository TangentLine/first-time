<h1>My Bio for Thursday</h1>

<h2>Carlvis Jones</h2>

<p>
	
	I am from Florida and living in Atlanta for half my life. I am a manual software tester currently so I am familiar with working on software development teams. My interest are motorsport including cars and motorcycle racing.  I just returned from Europe where I toured countries and watched a World Endurance Championship race in the UK. An image of the type of prototype race car at the race I went to is below.
